<h2> Get to know us better </h2>
<p> Our journey started back in 1990 when the son of our founder Mr. Smith Shawl requested him to get some plants on his birthday. Mr. Shawl brought 6 indoor plants for him and he was the happiest kid on the earth that day. Inspired from that momment Mr. Shawl went on to open the now the biggest e-commerce store of Saanich district. Our team has been growing every since. If you want to be a part of the history as well.
